CONTROL server can reach any base stations, sensors
SENSOR can move around a 2D space,  has a maximum communication range
Base Stations do not run any program

relay TCP messages between sensors -> CONTROL 
messages between base stations [linked]-> CONTROL

base station -> sensor . Sender: server. Receiver: sensor
base station communicate with sensor : infinity range

base station / sensor wants to send a msg:
1. check if recepient in range. If yes, send directly.
								If no, check all in-range sensors and base stations
by distance to the destination. Then send msg to b.s/sensor with lowest distance to
the final recipient. (No cycle). if ties, choose lexicographically smaller ID

ASSUME: all given ID exist
Clients will not disconnect until the end of the progam.



sensor to sensor:
	1. within distance, directly delivered. sensor-CONTROL-sensor
	2. out of distance, but can be delivered thru another sensor.
	   sensor-CONTROL-sensor-CONTROL-sensor

	3. out of distance, has to go thru base station. 
	    1. check all in-range, find the one closest to destination. Go.
	    Repeat this step. Mark visited B.S/Sensor, don't cause circle.
